      <h2> A Recommendation </h2>
        <a href="http://nefariouslair.com/comic/nefarious/">Nefarious</a><br>I found this little webcomic about a year ago and I loved it to pieces.  It follows the adventures of professional villain Crow and his work of being a freelance villain.  It's witty, vibrant, and full of poking fun at established tropes.  Give it a read if you want to see the bad guys win for a change.
